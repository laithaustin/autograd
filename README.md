# autograd
Building neural networks and machine learning models from scratch. This project aims to
consolidate my understanding of the logic and mechanisms that underpin both deep learning
and classical ML. 

Code requires only a few libraries and is intentionally minimalistic in nature.

Simply install the requirements: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

And then run your choice of script using: ```python sample_script.py```
